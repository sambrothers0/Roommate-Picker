# Roommate-Picker
This is a prototype of a website I completed for my Human-Computer Interaction class in Fall 2023.
During the project, my classmates and I designed a website to address a need in the Williamsburg area - the off campus housing shortage, and the need for finding good roommates.
We conducted user research by surveying students, compiled these results to inform our project, and prototyped a mockup website to help people pick thier roommates.
